I successfully applied my knowledge of React components, state management, and API integration to build Jammming, a web application that allows users to search the Spotify library and create custom playlists. By completing this project, I demonstrated my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and my ability to version control using Git and host repositories on GitHub. The project also showcases my understanding of HTTP requests and responses, as well as authentication with the Spotify API.
